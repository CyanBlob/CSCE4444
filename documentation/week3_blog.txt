Andrew T.

Completed:
Facebook authentication (creates an embedded web-browser where the user can sign in and give permissions to our system from Facebook. Returns an access token to be used for further API calls)
Team meeting

In Progress:
More Facebook APIs

Challenges:
Creating the embedded web-browser and checking for the access token took way longer than expected. Further API calls should be substantially easier now that we have the access token

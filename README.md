## Basic rundown
This is a hub-like application (Windows desktop) that will integrate various social media platforms (i.e., Facebook, Twitter, Twitch) and calendars (i.e., Outlook, Google), as well as allowing the user to create actionable, context-aware notifications and reminders.

The application should give the user notifications from all integrated platforms that the user can then save for later (create a reminder), dismiss, or immediately act upon.
